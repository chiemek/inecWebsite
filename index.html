        <h1>Message from the INEC Chairman</h1>
        <p>
          I am delighted to announce the official commencement of the
          September/October 2023 Permanent Voter Card (PVC) Collection Exercise
          in Bayelsa, Imo and Kogi States. This exercise is an essential step in
          ensuring your active participation in the upcoming Governorship
          elections, and we encourage all eligible voters to take part.
        </p>
        <p>
          The PVC Collection Exercise will run from the 11th of September 2023
          to the 9th of October 2023. During this period, registered voters in
          Bayelsa, Imo and Kogi states, who have not collected their <br />
          PVCs, can conveniently obtain them at designated collection centers.
        </p>
        <p>
          To facilitate a seamless process, we have launched a feature on the
          CVR portal where voters can <br />
          check the status of their voter cards and find the location of their
          designated pickup center. This <br />
          online tool will help you verify your eligibility and streamline the
          collection process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your PVC is your key to making your voice heard in our democratic
          process. We urge every eligible <br />
          voter, in the three states, to seize this opportunity to collect their
          PVCs and actively participate in <br />
          shaping their future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for your continued commitment to our democracy, and we look
          forward to your active engagement in the electoral process.
        </p>
